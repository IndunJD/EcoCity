Picture an employee at her computer, working with data. In the background, a hacker secretly accesses her company’s confidential files. He steals sensitive information and sells it to criminals, who then hold the company ransom for a profit.

It sounds like something out of a movie, but unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence in today’s online landscape. This is why Cyber Security has become such a vital part of any business strategy—and Cyber Security specialists are in demand now more than ever.

In this introduction to Cyber Security, you will learn how Cyber Security works, why it’s needed, what Cyber Security experts do to protect data, and how to become one.

What is Cyber Security?
Cyber Security is a process that’s designed to protect networks and devices from external threats. Businesses typically employ Cyber Security

professionals to protect their confidential information, maintain employee productivity, and enhance customer confidence in products and services.

The world of Cyber Security revolves around the industry standard of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or CIA. Privacy means data can be accessed only by authorized parties; integrity means information can be added, altered, or removed only by authorized users; and availability means systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters.

The main element of Cyber Security is the use of authentication mechanisms.
For example, a user name identifies an account that a user wants to access, while a
password is a mechanism that proves the user is who he claims to be.

Types of Cyber Crimes
Cybercrime is any unauthorized activity involving a computer, device, or network. The three types are computer-assisted crimes, crimes where the computer itself is a target, and crimes where the computer is incidental to the crime rather than directly related to it.

Cybercriminals usually try to prof
it off of their crimes using a varie
ty of tactics, including:

Denial of Service, or DOS
Where a hacker consumes all of a se
rver’s resources, so there’s nothing for leg
itimate users to access
Malware
Where victims are hit with   a worm or virus that renders their devices useless
Man in the Middle
Where a hacker puts himself between a victim’s machine and a router to sniff data packets
Phishing
Where a hacker send  s a seemingly legitimate-looking email asking users to disclose personal information
Other types of cyberat  tacks include cross-site scripting attacks, password attacks, eavesdropping attacks (which can also be physical), SQL-injection attacks, and birthday attacks based on algorithm functions.

What Motivates Cyber Crimina ls?
The main     motive  behind   the cybercrime is to disrupt regular business activity and critical infrastructure. Cybercriminals also commonly manipulate stolen data to benefit financially, cause financial loss, damage a reputation, achieve military objectives, and propagate religious or political beliefs. Some don’t even need a motive and might hack for fun or simply to showcase their skills.

So who are these cyb  ercriminals? Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:
Designing interactive systems is concerned with many different types of product. It is about designing whole
environments in which phones, PDAs, laptop computers, digital projectors and other devices communicate with
one another and through which people interact with one another. It is about designing interactive systems,
products and services for the home, for work or to support communities. Here are some examples of recent
interactive products and systems.
Example 1: iPhone
In 2007 Apple Inc. changed the face of mobile technologies when they introduced the iPhone. The
iPhone had a carefully crafted, purpose-designed interface to make use of the finger as the input
device. It had a                revolutionary touch-sensitive screen that allowed for multi-touch input. They
introduced 3D touch also commonly known as force touch with iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 2015.
Example 2: Wii
Also, in 2007 Nintendo introduced the Wii. The Wii was a revolutionary new games concept that used infra-red
sensors attached to an this paper we survey the state of the art in direct and indirect human computer interaction based biometrics. Direct HCI biometrics are based on abilities, style, preference, knowledge, or strategy used by people while working with a computer. The indirect HCI-based biometrics are events that can be obtained by monitoring users’ HCI behavior indirectly via observable low-level actions of computer software. We examine current research and analyze the types of features used to describe HCI behavior. After comparing accuracy rates for verification of users using different HCI- based biometric approaches we address privacy issues which arise with the use of HCI dependant biometrics. Finally, we present results of our experiments with direct and
 indirect HCI-based behavioral biometrics emp
 loyed as a part of an intrusion detection system TV or other display device to track a wand that transmitted infra-red signals. The new
system could, therefore, register different gestures such as a ‘bowling’ action, a
‘tennis shot’ action or a host of
other movements. The notion of computer games changed radically, from a young person shooting at imaginary
monsters, or driving imaginary cars, to a family-wide entertainment. When the ‘Wii fit’ was introduced it
appealed to a new audience of people wanting to keep fit at home.
