of user’s password is sufficient, but for recognition a large
 amount of keystroke data is needed and identification is based on comparisons
 with the profiles of all other existing users already in the system.     Keystroke
  features are based on time durations between the keystrokes, inter-key strokes and
  dwell times, which is the time a key is pressed down, overall typing speed, frequency of
  errors (use of backspace), use of numpad, order in which user presses shift key to get
  capital letters and possibly the force with which keys are hit for specially equipped keyboards
  [4, 5]. Keystroke dynamics is probably the most researched type of HCI-based biometric [6, 7],
   with novel research taking place in different languages [8], for long text samples, [9, 10] and for email authorship identification [41].     2) Mouse Dynamics: By monitoring all mouse actions produced by the user during interaction with the Graphical User Interface (GUI), a unique profile can be generated which can be used for user re-authentication [11]. Mouse actions of interest include general movement, drag and drop, point and click, and stillness. From those a set of features can be extracted for example average speed against the distance traveled, and average speed against the movement direction [12, 13]. Pusara et al. [11] describe a feature extraction approach in which they split the mouse event data into mouse wheel movements, clicks,  menu and toolbar
    clicks. Click data is further subdivided into single and double click data.      Gamboa et al. [14, 15] have tried to improve accuracy of mouse-dynamics-based biometrics by restricting the domain of data collection to an online game instead of a more general GUI environment.
As a result applicability of their results is somewhat restricted and the methodology is more in


nstead of seamless data collection during the normal to the user human
computer interaction. As far as the extracted features, x and y coordinates of the mouse,
 horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, tangential velocity, tangential acceleration,
 tangential jerk and angular velocity are utilized with respect to the mouse strokes to
 create a unique user profile.     3) Haptic:  Haptic systems are computer input/output
 devices which can provide us with information about direction, pressure, force, angle,
 speed, and position of user’s interactions [16, 17]. Because so much information is available
  about the user’s performance a high degree of accuracy can be expected from a haptic based
  biometrics system. Orozco et al. [16, 17] have created a simple haptic application built on an elastic membrane surface in
