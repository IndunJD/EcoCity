In every time, when you use any type of computing devices, there will be some kind of interaction in between
you and devices. Today, using these devices are very easy, technologies are very close to us. Even we don’t know
that we are using them. But, think, it is very difficult to build up such an interaction. As a IT practitioners and
students, it is not enough to use these technologies. Then, furthermore, you are able to understand the deepest
levels of such an interaction, how they work, how to make up new interactions and many more. Ok, then, let’s
start.
HCI (human-computer interaction) is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent
computers are developed for successful interaction with humans. Historically and with some exceptions,
computer system developers have not paid much attention to computer ease-of-use. Many computer users
today would argue that computer makers are still not paying enough attention to making their products "userfriendly." However, computer system developers might argue that computers are extremely complex products
to design and make and that the demand for the services that computers can provide has always outdriven the
demand for ease-of-use.
